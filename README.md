# encode-ballot

Encode Bootcamp: First Assignment

## Setup

1. Make sure you create a .env file with the real exported values as shown in .env.example.

2. Compile contracts with `yarn compile`

3. Run scripts - shortcuts can be found in package.json: `yarn <scriptName> args...`

```
"scripts": {
    "script:giveVotingRights": "ts-node --files ./scripts/Ballot/giveVotingRights.ts",
    "script:deploy": "ts-node --files ./scripts/Ballot/deployment.ts",
    "script:queryProposals": "ts-node --files ./scripts/Ballot/queryProposals.ts",
    "script:castVote": "ts-node --files ./scripts/Ballot/castVote.ts",
    "test": "hardhat test"
    "compile": "hardhat compile",
  }
```

Example:

```bash
# Deploy ballot contract with proposals [red, blue, green, orange]
$ yarn script:deploy red blue green orange

## Homework

- Read the references
- Finish covering other operations with scripts

## Weekend Project

- Structure scripts to
  - Deploy
  - Query proposals
  - Give vote right passing an address as input
  - Cast a vote to a ballot passing contract address and proposal as input and using the wallet in environment
  - Delegate my vote passing user address as input and using the wallet in environment
  - Query voting result and print to console
- Publish the project in Github
- Run the scripts with a set of proposals, cast and delegate votes and inspect results
- Write a report detailing the addresses, transaction hashes, description of the operation script being executed and console output from script execution for each step (Deployment, giving voting rights, casting/delegating and querying results).
- (Extra) Use TDD methodology
